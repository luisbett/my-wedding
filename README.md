## About

This was my fourth project built using React JS + TypeScript, and the objective was to create a web app where my guests could record videos at my wedding and send straight to me in my firebase storage folder after finishing recording it. This way, they wouldn't need to send the video manually after recording it.

After creating this feature I decided to make the app able to give important information about my wedding party to my guests. On it they could see the schedule of the night, the menu, my wishlist for presents and my PIX key used in Brazil to send money, that they could give as a present as well.

In this project, I used different packages:

* [**react-i18next**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-i18next) for internationalization, so the mom can write in more than one language;
* [**react-icons**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) for the icons in the project;

I learned a lot about the React infrastructure, such as how to create my own hooks and that it is not allowed to call hooks inside other hooks, only from components.

I chose to use Vite to minimize the initial setup and invest more time in working on the project's business logic.
